APPROACH 
I first changed the banner section to the thing that was sent on mail 

Then I made a js file 
Which had a counter (i) then i made a list of all the photos 

Then i made a function change image 
In this function the i made such that the counter value changes so that i can use that counter to access the list of images and then change the images 

Then i set an interval that runs the function after every set time

CHALLENGES 
The first thing was how to make the function run after every fixed time 

Then when i ran the page then the images we not appearing properly some where blurred and some where positioned out


HOW I OVERCAME 
For the function to run after fixed time i used setInterval function 

For the images i changed some of the images that were getting blurred and made changes to the CSS
