APPORACH:
I first made the form.html page which had the HTML strcuture for the form
I linked this html page to the index.js
JavaScript was used to handle the interaction between the CTA button and the form. The CTA button click event triggers the display of the form and hides the button. and also the how things wouldbe inputted and how will we get the errors
at the end i linked the cta button in index.html to form.html 

CHALLENGES FACED

Implementing validation for different fields and updating the visual feedback was another challenge. Managing error messages and success states required careful JavaScript coding.

challenge i faced was when i clicked the cta button it didnt trigger anything

HOW I OVERCAME 

I made changes to the js file so i get errors and the input were right 

in order for the cta button to trigger the form when clicked i directed it to the form file so thag its opens the forms which inturn was linked to the js file
